# visual-xml-editor
This is a generic XML editing tool that evolved from an embedded XML Editor in a previous modding tool development project \(x-changeling\). The tool was primarily inspired because of the apparent lack of free XML tools that could handle large XML files without a lot of messing around \(if at all\). 

It is written in C# using Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop and intended for use in a 64-bit Windows environment running .NET v4.5. 

*DISCLAIMER: The title "Visual XML Editor" is a nod to the GUI Tree and Property list approach taken for the XML Viewer/Editor and is not related in any shape or form to the Microsoft products of a similar name. Neither is the tool either endorsed or supported by Microsoft.*
